# Responsible Disclosure & Security Guidelines

HackAgent is a powerful security testing framework designed to help identify vulnerabilities in AI systems. With this power comes responsibility. This guide outlines the ethical and legal considerations for using HackAgent responsibly.

## 🛡️ Core Principles

### 1. Authorization First
**NEVER test systems without explicit permission**

- ✅ **Your own AI agents and systems**
- ✅ **Systems you own or operate**
- ✅ **Authorized penetration testing engagements with written permission**
- ✅ **Research environments with proper approval**
- ❌ **Third-party systems without permission**
- ❌ **Production systems without approval**
- ❌ **Systems owned by others**

### 2. Minimize Harm
**Testing should not cause damage or disruption**

- ✅ Use minimal test cases to demonstrate vulnerability
- ✅ Avoid overwhelming systems with excessive requests
- ✅ Stop testing once vulnerability is confirmed
- ❌ Don't attempt to access sensitive data beyond proof-of-concept
- ❌ Don't disrupt normal system operations
- ❌ Don't delete or modify data

### 3. Respect Privacy
**Protect user data and privacy at all times**

- ✅ Use synthetic or dummy data for testing
- ✅ Immediately delete any accidentally accessed personal data
- ✅ Report data exposure without accessing the data
- ❌ Don't attempt to access personal information
- ❌ Don't store or share discovered sensitive data
- ❌ Don't use real user data in tests

## 📋 Pre-Testing Checklist

Before using HackAgent, ensure you can answer **YES** to all these questions:

- [ ] Do I have explicit written permission to test this system?
- [ ] Have I identified the appropriate contact for security issues?
- [ ] Do I understand the system's acceptable use policy?
- [ ] Am I prepared to report findings responsibly?
- [ ] Do I have a plan to minimize potential harm?
- [ ] Am I complying with applicable laws and regulations?

## 🔍 Vulnerability Discovery Process

### Phase 1: Preparation
1. **Document Permission**: Keep written authorization for your testing
2. **Identify Contacts**: Know who to contact for security issues
3. **Plan Testing**: Define scope and limitations of your testing
4. **Set Boundaries**: Establish what you will and won't test

### Phase 2: Testing
1. **Start Small**: Begin with minimal, non-invasive tests
2. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of your testing
3. **Monitor Impact**: Watch for any negative system effects
4. **Stop at Discovery**: Cease testing once vulnerability is confirmed

### Phase 3: Reporting
1. **Report Promptly**: Contact the responsible party quickly
2. **Provide Details**: Include clear reproduction steps
3. **Suggest Fixes**: Offer remediation suggestions when possible
4. **Follow Up**: Maintain communication throughout the process

## 📧 Responsible Disclosure Process

### 1. Initial Discovery
When you discover a vulnerability using HackAgent:

**IMMEDIATELY:**
- Stop further exploitation attempts
- Document the vulnerability with minimal proof-of-concept
- Do not access sensitive data or disrupt services
- Begin the disclosure process

### 2. Contact the Vendor/Owner

**Preferred Contact Methods (in order):**
1. **Security Email**: security@company.com
2. **Bug Bounty Program**: Vendor's designated platform
3. **Direct Security Contact**: Named security personnel
4. **General Contact**: info@company.com with "SECURITY" subject

**Initial Disclosure Email Template:**
```
Subject: Security Vulnerability Report - [Brief Description]

Dear Security Team,

I am a security researcher and have discovered a potential vulnerability 
in your AI system while conducting authorized security testing using 
HackAgent (an open-source AI security testing framework).

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:
- System: [System name/URL]
- Type: [e.g., Prompt Injection, Jailbreak]
- Severity: [Your assessment]
- Discovery Date: [Date]

IMPACT:
[Brief description of potential impact]

I would like to work with your team to resolve this issue responsibly.
I can provide detailed technical information and reproduction steps
once we establish secure communication.

Please respond within 5 business days to acknowledge receipt of this
report and provide guidance on next steps.

Thank you for your time and commitment to security.

Best regards,
[Your name]
[Your contact information]
```

### 3. Coordinated Disclosure Timeline

**Standard Timeline:**
- **Day 0**: Initial vulnerability report
- **Day 5**: Vendor acknowledgment expected
- **Day 10**: Detailed technical information shared
- **Day 30**: Vendor provides initial fix timeline
- **Day 90**: Public disclosure (if fixed) or discussion of extended timeline

**Factors for Timeline Adjustment:**
- **Severity**: Critical vulnerabilities may need faster resolution
- **Complexity**: Complex fixes may require more time
- **Vendor Response**: Cooperative vendors may get extended timelines
- **Public Risk**: Active exploitation may accelerate disclosure

### 4. Public Disclosure

**Before Public Disclosure:**
- Ensure vendor has had adequate time to fix
- Verify the fix is effective
- Coordinate disclosure timing with vendor
- Prepare educational content about the vulnerability class

**Public Disclosure Should Include:**
- High-level vulnerability description
- Impact assessment
- Timeline of discovery and fix
- General mitigation strategies
- Credit to vendor for cooperation (if appropriate)

**Public Disclosure Should NOT Include:**
- Step-by-step exploitation instructions
- Specific system details that could aid attackers
- Information that could compromise ongoing security measures

## ⚖️ Legal Considerations

### Know Your Jurisdiction
Security testing laws vary by location. Key legal frameworks include:

**United States:**
- Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)
- State computer crime laws

- Computer Misuse Acts (varies by country)
- Cybersecurity legislation

**Other Regions:**
- Research local cybersecurity and computer crime laws
- Understand data protection requirements
- Consider cross-border legal implications

### Legal Best Practices
1. **Get Written Permission**: Always obtain explicit authorization
2. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of your activities
3. **Consult Legal Counsel**: When in doubt, seek legal advice
4. **Respect Boundaries**: Stay within authorized scope
5. **Report Responsibly**: Follow coordinated disclosure practices
