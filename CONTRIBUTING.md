### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to HackAgent? You can start by looking through `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

*   [Good first issues](https://github.com/vistalabs-org/hackagent/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
*   [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/vistalabs-org/hackagent/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issue` issues.

*   Fix problems that are important to users
*   Engage the community in working toward the best possible HackAgent
*   Enable a sustainable system for HackAgent's maintainers to review contributions
